# PI-Estimation-using-Monte-Carlo-MP
Monte Carlo sampling is used to estimate volume of sphere with fixed radius 2 and pi is esimated from volume. A sys arg is inputed by user to determine how many samples are taken, all sampling and checking sample location in/out sphere has been moved to parallel processing.
